MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A WORKING COPY, OLD OR NEW, OF THE APP FOR TOMORROW
Refactor the adminRoutes.js code so that the 24 products are created in the add Category post route instead of the get route for create-product
INSTRUCTIONS:
-- Refactor your code so that product creation from adminRoutes.js is a createProducts function that lives in a helper folder in a createProducts.js file on the same level as adminRoutes.js
-- The function should return a promise and create all the products for the given category.
-- The function should be called in the add category post route
-- Make sure that on creation of the category and products the app remains on the Add New Category page and flashes the success message we created 
'Successfully created <name of category> and 24 products'
-- don't forget to .catch the error for the  createProducts function in the get route where you call it.
ALSO:
-- Refactor and abstract the validation code in the Add Category Post route to use as a middleware in order to consolidate and neaten the route.
-- Place in a folder called adminValidation in a file called categoryValidation.js
